<summary><strong>1. What are the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript?</strong></summary>

### 1. Static Typing
TypeScript adds **static typing**, allowing developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values. 
JavaScript uses **dynamic typing**, so types are inferred at runtime.

```ts
// TypeScript
let age: number = 25;
let name: string = "Iryna";
```

```js
// JavaScript
let age = 25; // type is inferred at runtime
let name = "Iryna";
```

---

### 2. Compilation vs Interpretation
- **TypeScript** code must be compiled into JavaScript to run in browsers or Node.js.
- **JavaScript** is interpreted directly by the engine.

---

### 3. Modern JS Features Support
- **TypeScript** supports all modern JS features (like ES6+), even in environments that don‚Äôt support them natively.
- **JavaScript** depends on the runtime environment (e.g., browser, Node.js) for feature support.

---

### 4. Interfaces and Classes
- **TypeScript** supports **interfaces** and has extended capabilities for classes.
- **JavaScript** lacks interfaces and only added basic class syntax with ES6.

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

let person: Person = {
  name: "Iryna",
  age: 25
};
```

---

### 5. Development Experience
- **TypeScript** offers better editor support with **autocompletion**, **IntelliSense**, and **type-checking**.
- **JavaScript** provides limited static analysis capabilities.

---

### 6. Error Detection
- **TypeScript** can catch many errors at **compile time**.
- **JavaScript** errors usually appear only at **runtime**, making debugging harder.

---

### Conclusion
TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that enhances developer experience with static typing, error checking, and modern JS support. However, it requires a compilation step before execution.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using TypeScript?</strong></summary>

### ‚úÖ Advantages

#### 1. Static Typing
TypeScript allows you to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors during development.

```ts
let count: number = 10;
count = "text"; // Compilation error
```

---

#### 2. Better Editor Support
Thanks to type annotations, editors provide better autocomplete, IntelliSense, and refactoring tools.

---

#### 3. Early Error Detection
TypeScript detects many errors during compilation, reducing bugs in production.

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

add(5, "3"); // Compilation error
```

---

#### 4. Modern JavaScript Features
TypeScript supports all ES6+ features (like classes, arrow functions, async/await), even in older environments.

```ts
class Person {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}
}

const iryna = new Person("Iryna", 25);
```

---

#### 5. Scalability
TypeScript improves maintainability and scalability in large projects due to type safety and modular code organization.

---

#### 6. Compatibility with JavaScript
All valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript. You can gradually adopt TS in existing JS projects.

```ts
const greet = (name) => console.log("Hello, " + name); // Valid JS in TS
```

---

### ‚ùå Disadvantages

#### 1. Compilation Step
TypeScript must be compiled to JavaScript before execution, adding complexity to the build process.

---

#### 2. Learning Curve
For beginners or JS-only developers, understanding types, interfaces, generics, and access modifiers can be challenging.

---

#### 3. More Boilerplate Code
Declaring types and interfaces can make code more verbose.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: User = { name: "Iryna", age: 25 };
```

---

#### 4. Configuration Overhead
You need to set up `tsconfig.json` and possibly other tools like Webpack or Babel for TS integration.

---

#### 5. Overhead in Small Projects
For quick prototypes or small scripts, static typing might feel unnecessary and slow down development.

---

### üîö Conclusion
TypeScript enhances code safety, tooling, and scalability, making it ideal for large or long-term projects. However, it introduces extra setup and a steeper learning curve compared to plain JavaScript.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. What are data types in TypeScript and how are they used?</strong></summary>

TypeScript uses static typing, which means variables, function parameters, return values, and object properties can all have defined types. This makes code more predictable, easier to debug, and safer in large-scale projects.

---

### üî§ Basic Types

#### `number`
Used for numeric values (both integers and floats).
```ts
let age: number = 25;
let pi: number = 3.14;
```

#### `string`
Text values, either in quotes or template literals.
```ts
let name: string = "Iryna";
let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

#### `boolean`
Logical true/false.
```ts
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
```

#### `array`
List of values of a specific type.
```ts
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let names: Array<string> = ["Anna", "Iryna"];
```

#### `tuple`
Fixed-length array with defined types for each element.
```ts
let person: [string, number] = ["Iryna", 25];
```

#### `enum`
A set of named constants.
```ts
enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
```

#### `any`
Disables type checking ‚Äî use with caution.
```ts
let randomValue: any = "Hello";
randomValue = 42; // allowed
```

#### `void`
Function that returns no value.
```ts
function logMessage(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
}
```

#### `null` and `undefined`
Represent the absence of a value.
```ts
let emptyValue: null = null;
let notAssigned: undefined = undefined;
```

#### `object`
Defines an object with key-value pairs.
```ts
let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
  name: "Iryna",
  age: 25,
};
```

---

### üß© Advanced Types

#### Interfaces
Custom object type definitions.
```ts
interface Car {
  brand: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
}

let car: Car = {
  brand: "Tesla",
  model: "Model 3",
  year: 2020,
};
```

#### Union Types
Allows a variable to be one of several types.
```ts
let value: number | string;
value = 10;
value = "Hello";
```

#### Literal Types
Restrict values to a specific set.
```ts
let status: "active" | "inactive" | "pending";
status = "active";
```

#### Function Types
Specify parameter and return types for functions.
```ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

let multiply: (x: number, y: number) => number = (x, y) => x * y;
```

---

### üìå Conclusion
Using TypeScript's type system helps reduce runtime errors, improves code clarity, and supports large-scale development through better tooling and readability.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. What is the difference between <code>type</code> and <code>interface</code> in TypeScript?</strong></summary>

In TypeScript, both <code>type</code> and <code>interface</code> are used to define custom types. However, they serve slightly different purposes and have different capabilities.

---

### üß± <code>type</code> Keyword

<code>type</code> is used to define a type alias ‚Äî a name for any type, including:
- primitives
- unions/intersections
- object types
- functions

```ts
export type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
};

const user: User = {
  name: "Iryna",
  age: 25,
  isActive: true,
};
```

### üß© <code>interface</code> Keyword

<code>interface</code> is used to describe the shape of objects and is typically used when designing class or object structures.

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "Anna",
  age: 30,
};
```

---

### üîç Key Differences

| Feature | <code>type</code> | <code>interface</code> |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Extends** | Can use intersections (<code>&</code>) | Can use <code>extends</code> keyword |
| **Unions** | ‚úÖ Supports union types | ‚ùå Not supported |
| **Declaration merging** | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ Interfaces with same name are merged |
| **Complex types** | ‚úÖ Supports tuples, unions, intersections, primitives | ‚ùå Only for object shapes |

---

### üìå Examples

#### Intersection with <code>type</code>
```ts
type Vehicle = {
  brand: string;
};

type Car = Vehicle & {
  model: string;
};
```

#### Extending with <code>interface</code>
```ts
interface Employee extends Person {
  position: string;
}
```

#### Union with <code>type</code>
```ts
type Status = "active" | "inactive" | "pending";
```

#### Declaration Merging with <code>interface</code>
```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Iryna",
  age: 25,
};
```

---

### üß† Conclusion
- Use <code>interface</code> when describing object shapes or when you need declaration merging.
- Use <code>type</code> for unions, intersections, or when aliasing primitives and tuples.

Both are powerful tools, and in many cases, the choice is a matter of style or preference.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. What is a type intersection in TypeScript?</strong></summary>

Type intersections in TypeScript allow you to combine multiple types into one. This is done using the <code>&</code> operator.

---

### üîó What is a type intersection?

A type intersection creates a new type that includes **all** properties from the intersected types. It's like merging multiple type definitions into one:

```ts
type Car = {
  brand: string;
  model: string;
};

type Engine = {
  horsepower: number;
};

type Vehicle = Car & Engine & {
  year: number;
};

const myVehicle: Vehicle = {
  brand: "Tesla",
  model: "Model S",
  horsepower: 670,
  year: 2021
};
```

In this example, the new type <code>Vehicle</code> includes properties from <code>Car</code>, <code>Engine</code>, and an additional <code>year</code> field.

---

### üîç Type Intersection vs Union

| Concept | Intersection (<code>&</code>) | Union (<code>|</code>) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Meaning | Must satisfy **all** types | Can satisfy **any one** type |
| Example |
<pre><code>type A = { name: string };
type B = { age: number };
type AB = A & B;
// AB must have both name and age</code></pre> |
<pre><code>type A = { name: string };
type B = { age: number };
type AB = A | B;
// AB can have just name, just age, or both</code></pre> |

---

### üß† Summary
- <strong>Intersection types</strong> merge all members from multiple types ‚Äî useful when an object must conform to multiple constraints.
- They are commonly used with <code>type</code> and not <code>interface</code>.

This is exactly what happens in:
```ts
type Vehicle = Car & { year: number };
```
You're creating a new type that includes everything from <code>Car</code> and adds <code>year</code>.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. What are interfaces in TypeScript?</strong></summary>

Interfaces in TypeScript are used to define the structure of an object. They act as contracts in your code, helping ensure that objects adhere to a specific shape.

---

### üìå Key Features of Interfaces

- **Describe object shape:** Define the required and optional properties and methods.
- **Inheritance:** Interfaces can extend one or more other interfaces using `extends`.
- **Declaration merging:** Multiple declarations with the same name are automatically merged.

---

### üß± Basic Example

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  greet(): string;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Iryna",
  age: 25,
  isActive: true,
  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
  }
};

console.log(user.greet()); // "Hello, my name is Iryna"
```

---

### üß¨ Inheriting from Another Interface

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  position: string;
}

const employee: Employee = {
  name: "Iryna",
  age: 25,
  position: "Frontend Developer"
};
```

The `Employee` interface inherits `name` and `age` from `Person` and adds a `position` property.

---

### ‚ùì Optional Properties

Use `?` to mark a property as optional:

```ts
interface Car {
  brand: string;
  model: string;
  year?: number;
}

const car1: Car = { brand: "Tesla", model: "Model S" };
const car2: Car = { brand: "Tesla", model: "Model X", year: 2021 };
```

---

### üîÅ Function Interfaces

Interfaces can describe function signatures:

```ts
interface MathOperation {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}

const add: MathOperation = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiply: MathOperation = (a, b) => a * b;
```

---

### üîÑ Declaration Merging

Interfaces with the same name get merged:

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Iryna",
  age: 25
};
```

Both declarations are combined into a single interface.

---

### üß† Summary
- Interfaces are contracts for object structure.
- They can include methods, optional properties, and support inheritance.
- Use interfaces when designing reusable object types and APIs.
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes when using declaration merging.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>7. When should you use <code>type</code> vs <code>interface</code> in TypeScript?</strong></summary>

Choosing between <code>type</code> and <code>interface</code> in TypeScript depends on the structure you're defining and how you intend to use or extend it. Both can describe the shape of objects, but they have differences in capabilities and syntax.

---

### ‚úÖ Use <code>interface</code> when:

#### 1. **Describing object shapes or class structures**
Interfaces are ideal for describing the structure of an object or class, especially when you want to leverage inheritance.

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  position: string;
}
```

#### 2. **You need declaration merging**
You can declare the same interface multiple times, and TypeScript will merge them.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

const user: User = { name: "Iryna", age: 25 };
```

#### 3. **Working in ecosystems like React**
Interfaces are commonly used for typing props, state, and context in React projects.

---

### ‚úÖ Use <code>type</code> when:

#### 1. **You need unions, intersections, or primitives**
<code>type</code> aliases are better suited for combining types or describing primitives, tuples, or functions.

```ts
// Union
type ID = string | number;

// Intersection
type Car = {
  brand: string;
};

type Vehicle = Car & {
  year: number;
};

// Tuple
type Coordinates = [number, number];

const point: Coordinates = [10, 20];
```

#### 2. **Typing functions directly**
<code>type</code> can define function signatures more flexibly:

```ts
type MathOperation = (a: number, b: number) => number;

const multiply: MathOperation = (a, b) => a * b;
```

#### 3. **You don't need to extend or merge**
<code>type</code> cannot be reopened to add new properties, unlike <code>interface</code>.

---

### üìä Summary Table

| Feature | <code>interface</code> | <code>type</code> |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Inheritance | ‚úÖ via <code>extends</code> | ‚úÖ via intersections (&) |
| Declaration merging | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Unions / intersections | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Describes functions | ‚úÖ (less commonly used) | ‚úÖ |
| Tuples / primitives | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

---

### üß† Recommendation
- Use <strong><code>interface</code></strong> for objects, class structures, and when declaration merging is needed.
- Use <strong><code>type</code></strong> for primitives, tuples, function types, and when working with unions or intersections.
- When in doubt, follow your team‚Äôs convention. If no convention exists, prefer <code>interface</code> for objects.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>8. Can you intersect a primitive type with an object type in TypeScript?</strong></summary>

No, you cannot intersect a primitive type (like <code>string</code>) with an object type (like <code>{ age: number }</code>) in a meaningful or useful way. TypeScript will not allow this because these types are incompatible by nature.

---

### üö´ Example of incompatible intersection

```ts
type A = string; // primitive type
type B = { age: number }; // object type

type AB = A & B; // ‚ùå Invalid: TypeScript will error here
```

TypeScript will produce an error similar to:

```
Type 'string' is not assignable to type '{ age: number; }'.
```

---

### ‚úÖ Example of compatible intersection (only object types)

If both types are object types, the intersection works as expected:

```ts
type A = { name: string };
type B = { age: number };

type AB = A & B;

const person: AB = {
  name: "Iryna",
  age: 25,
};
```

In this case, the resulting type <code>AB</code> must contain both <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>.

---

### üß† Summary

- Intersection (<code>&</code>) combines all properties from both types.
- This only works when types are compatible‚Äîtypically both being object types.
- You **cannot** intersect a primitive type (like <code>string</code>) with an object type, because primitives do not have properties.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>9. How do Generics work in TypeScript and why are they useful?</strong></summary>

  <p>
    Generics in TypeScript provide a way to create reusable components (functions, classes, interfaces) that work with different types while maintaining type safety. Instead of hardcoding specific types, generics use a type variable that is specified later.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Example of a generic function:</strong></p>

  ```ts
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }

  const result1 = identity<string>("Hello");
  const result2 = identity<number>(42);
  ```

  <p>
    Here, <code>T</code> is a placeholder type. TypeScript infers the type when the function is called, ensuring type safety.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Generic class example:</strong></p>

  ```ts
  class Box<T> {
    content: T;

    constructor(content: T) {
      this.content = content;
    }

    getContent(): T {
      return this.content;
    }
  }

  const stringBox = new Box<string>("Hello");
  const numberBox = new Box<number>(123);
  ```

  <p>
    The class <code>Box</code> is reusable with any type you provide.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Generic interface example:</strong></p>

  ```ts
  interface Pair<T, U> {
    first: T;
    second: U;
  }

  const pair: Pair<string, number> = {
    first: "Age",
    second: 25
  };
  ```

  <p><strong>Generics with constraints:</strong></p>

  ```ts
  function getLength<T extends { length: number }>(arg: T): number {
    return arg.length;
  }

  getLength("Hello"); // 5
  getLength([1, 2, 3]); // 3
  ```

  <p>
    Constraints limit the accepted types to ones that meet specific criteria‚Äîin this case, having a <code>length</code> property.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Why use Generics?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Code reusability:</strong> Write once, use with many types.</li>
    <li><strong>Type safety:</strong> Catch errors at compile time.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Build complex structures without losing type information.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In summary, generics let you write flexible, reusable, and type-safe code in TypeScript, which makes them a fundamental feature of the language.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>10. How can Enums be used in TypeScript and what are their advantages?</strong></summary>

  <p>
    Enums in TypeScript allow you to define a set of named constants that can be either numeric or string values. They are especially useful when you want to represent a fixed set of options.
  </p>

  <h4>Numeric Enums</h4>
  <p>By default, enum members are assigned numeric values starting from 0, but you can also assign custom values:</p>

  ```ts
  enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
  }

  let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
  console.log(move); // 0
  ```

  <p>You can also explicitly assign values:</p>

  ```ts
  enum Status {
    Active = 1,
    Inactive,
    Pending,
  }

  console.log(Status.Active);   // 1
  console.log(Status.Inactive); // 2
  console.log(Status.Pending);  // 3
  ```

  <h4>String Enums</h4>
  <p>Each member must be initialized with a string literal:</p>

  ```ts
  enum Response {
    Yes = "YES",
    No = "NO",
  }

  let reply: Response = Response.Yes;
  console.log(reply); // "YES"
  ```

  <h4>Advantages of using Enums:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Improved readability:</strong> Use of named values instead of magic numbers or strings makes code more understandable.</li>
    <li><strong>Static typing:</strong> TypeScript ensures only valid enum values are used.</li>
    <li><strong>Easier debugging:</strong> Named constants are more descriptive and easier to debug.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Support for both numeric and string values.</li>
    <li><strong>Bidirectional mapping (for numeric enums):</strong> You can get the name from the value and vice versa:</li>
  </ul>

  ```ts
  enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
  }

  console.log(Direction[1]); // "Up"
  console.log(Direction.Up); // 1
  ```

  <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Potential confusion with numeric values:</strong> Automatic incrementing can lead to mistakes if enum order changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Larger compiled output:</strong> Enums can increase the size of the generated JavaScript compared to simple objects or constants.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Enums in TypeScript are a powerful way to define fixed sets of values with clear type safety, improved structure, and better code clarity.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>11. What refactoring and code maintenance capabilities does TypeScript provide?</strong></summary>

  <p>
    TypeScript offers a wide range of tools that greatly improve code refactoring and maintainability. Its static typing system, advanced type features, and integration with modern IDEs make code more reliable, understandable, and easier to evolve. Here are the key capabilities:
  </p>

  <h4>1. Static Typing</h4>
  <p>
    TypeScript detects errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This prevents many common bugs, such as calling non-existent properties or passing the wrong argument types.
  </p>

  ```ts
  function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }

  sum(10, "20"); // Error: Argument of type '"20"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
  ```

  <h4>2. Interfaces and Type Aliases</h4>
  <p>
    Interfaces and types help structure and centralize definitions, making large codebases easier to manage and refactor.
  </p>

  ```ts
  interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }

  const user: User = { name: "John", age: 30 };
  ```

  <h4>3. IDE Autocompletion and Tooling</h4>
  <p>
    With TypeScript, editors like VS Code offer powerful autocompletion, navigation, and inline documentation based on types.
  </p>

  ```ts
  user.name; // IDE shows available properties and types
  ```

  <h4>4. Generics</h4>
  <p>
    Generics enable the creation of reusable, type-safe functions and data structures.
  </p>

  ```ts
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }

  identity<number>(42); // Works with multiple types while preserving type safety
  ```

  <h4>5. Modules and Namespacing</h4>
  <p>
    TypeScript supports modular architecture, allowing logical separation of code into files and modules.
  </p>

  ```ts
  // math.ts
  export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }

  // main.ts
  import { add } from './math';
  console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
  ```

  <h4>6. Built-in Refactoring Tools in IDEs</h4>
  <p>
    Features like "Rename Symbol" or "Find All References" work more reliably with TypeScript because of its typed AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Safely rename variables and functions across files.</li>
    <li>Track usage of types and interfaces across your codebase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Extendable Types</h4>
  <p>
    Interfaces and types can be extended without rewriting existing structures.
  </p>

  ```ts
  interface Person {
    name: string;
  }

  interface Employee extends Person {
    salary: number;
  }

  const employee: Employee = { name: "John", salary: 1000 };
  ```

  <h4>8. Type-Safe Complex Structures</h4>
  <p>
    TypeScript validates deeply nested data and ensures their correct usage.
  </p>

  ```ts
  type User = {
    name: string;
    address: {
      city: string;
      zip: string;
    };
  };

  const user: User = {
    name: "Alice",
    address: {
      city: "New York",
      zip: "10001",
    },
  };
  ```

  <h4>9. Union and Intersection Types</h4>
  <p>
    These types allow better expression of possible object shapes or function return values.
  </p>

  ```ts
  type Success = { status: "success"; data: string };
  type Error = { status: "error"; message: string };
  type Response = Success | Error;

  function handleResponse(response: Response) {
    if (response.status === "success") {
      console.log(response.data);
    } else {
      console.log(response.message);
    }
  }
  ```

  <h4>10. Gradual Adoption and Compatibility</h4>
  <p>
    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning you can adopt it gradually without rewriting existing code.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> TypeScript empowers developers with strong typing, reusable abstractions, and IDE-friendly features. These advantages result in cleaner, more maintainable code and easier refactoring in both small and large-scale applications.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>12. What are decorators in TypeScript and when are they used?</strong></summary>

  <p>
    Decorators are special functions in TypeScript that allow you to modify the behavior of classes, methods, properties, or parameters. They provide a declarative way to add cross-cutting concerns (like logging, validation, or dependency injection) without changing the core logic of your code.
  </p>

  <h4>üîß How to enable decorators</h4>
  <p>
    Since decorators are still a stage 3 proposal in JavaScript, you need to enable them in TypeScript by setting <code>"experimentalDecorators": true</code> in your <code>tsconfig.json</code> file.
  </p>

  <h4>üìå Types of decorators</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Class decorators</strong> ‚Äî modify or annotate a class</li>
    <li><strong>Method decorators</strong> ‚Äî wrap or enhance a method</li>
    <li><strong>Property decorators</strong> ‚Äî affect property descriptors</li>
    <li><strong>Parameter decorators</strong> ‚Äî attach metadata to method parameters</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>1. Class Decorator</h4>
  <p>Example of sealing a class:</p>
  
  ```ts
  function Sealed(constructor: Function) {
    Object.seal(constructor);
    Object.seal(constructor.prototype);
  }

  @Sealed
  class Person {
    name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
      this.name = name;
    }
  }
  ```

  <h4>2. Method Decorator</h4>
  <p>Logging method calls:</p>

  ```ts
  function Log(target: Object, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
    descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
      console.log(`Method ${propertyKey} called with args:`, args);
      return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    };
  }

  class Calculator {
    @Log
    add(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a + b;
    }
  }
  ```

  <h4>3. Property Decorator</h4>
  <p>Making a property read-only:</p>

  ```ts
  function Readonly(target: Object, propertyKey: string) {
    Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, {
      writable: false,
    });
  }

  class Car {
    @Readonly
    model: string = "Tesla";
  }
  ```

  <h4>4. Parameter Decorator</h4>
  <p>Decorating a parameter of a method:</p>

  ```ts
  function LogParam(target: Object, propertyKey: string, parameterIndex: number) {
    console.log(`Parameter ${parameterIndex} of method ${propertyKey} has been decorated.`);
  }

  class Engine {
    start(@LogParam speed: number) {
      console.log(`Engine started at speed: ${speed}`);
    }
  }
  ```

  <h4>‚úÖ Benefits of decorators</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean separation of concerns</li>
    <li>Reusable logic (e.g., logging, caching)</li>
    <li>Integration with frameworks like Angular</li>
    <li>Improve modularity and testability</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>üìå When to use decorators?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, or authorization</li>
    <li>To enhance classes/methods without modifying core business logic</li>
    <li>In frameworks like Angular for dependency injection and metadata</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Decorators in TypeScript offer a powerful, expressive way to modify behavior at runtime in a declarative fashion. They're especially useful in enterprise-grade applications or when working with decorator-driven frameworks.</p>

  <summary><strong>13. How are namespaces and modules used in TypeScript?</strong></summary>

  <p>
    TypeScript offers two main ways to organize code: <strong>namespaces</strong> and <strong>modules</strong>. Both help structure code but are used in different scenarios and have distinct features.
  </p>

  <h4>1. Namespaces</h4>
  <p>
    Namespaces group logically related code within one or multiple files. They help avoid naming conflicts and organize large codebases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Declared with the <code>namespace</code> keyword, and elements inside can be made accessible outside by using <code>export</code>.
  </p>

  <pre><code lang="ts">
// Example of namespace
namespace Shapes {
  export class Circle {
    constructor(public radius: number) {}
    getArea(): number {
      return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
    }
  }

  export class Square {
    constructor(public side: number) {}
    getArea(): number {
      return this.side * this.side;
    }
  }
}

const circle = new Shapes.Circle(5);
console.log(circle.getArea()); // Outputs the circle area

const square = new Shapes.Square(10);
console.log(square.getArea()); // Outputs the square area
  </code></pre>

  <p><strong>Key points about namespaces:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Good for organizing code within one or a few related files.</li>
    <li>Accessing elements requires specifying the namespace name, which can lead to longer access paths.</li>
    <li>More popular before ES6 modules became standard; now less commonly used.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Modules</h4>
  <p>
    Modules are the modern, standard way to organize code in TypeScript and JavaScript, based on the ES6 (ES2015) module system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each file that contains <code>import</code> or <code>export</code> statements is considered a module.
  </p>

  <pre><code lang="ts">
// shapes.ts (module exporting classes)
export class Circle {
  constructor(public radius: number) {}
  getArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

export class Square {
  constructor(public side: number) {}
  getArea(): number {
    return this.side * this.side;
  }
}

// main.ts (module importing classes)
import { Circle, Square } from './shapes';

const circle = new Circle(5);
console.log(circle.getArea()); // Outputs the circle area

const square = new Square(10);
console.log(square.getArea()); // Outputs the square area
  </code></pre>

  <p><strong>Key points about modules:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each file is a separate module.</li>
    <li>Clear control over what code is public (exported) and private.</li>
    <li>Imported elements can be renamed to avoid naming conflicts.</li>
    <li>Supported natively in modern browsers and Node.js.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Comparison: Namespaces vs Modules</h4>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Namespaces</th><th>Modules</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Group related code inside one or multiple files.</td>
        <td>Split code into separate files with explicit imports and exports.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Syntax groups elements inside a single file.</td>
        <td>Each file is its own module.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Require specifying namespace name to access elements.</td>
        <td>Use import/export syntax to access elements.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Less popular after ES6 module standardization.</td>
        <td>The modern, widely adopted approach.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Not supported outside TypeScript without compilation.</td>
        <td>Supported by all ES6-compliant environments.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h4>When to use which?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Namespaces are suitable for small projects or organizing code within one file, but are becoming less common.</li>
    <li>Modules are recommended for most cases, especially large projects, because they enable code splitting and better dependency management.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Modules are the standard and recommended way to organize modern TypeScript and JavaScript projects, supported by the ES6 standard. Namespaces may still be useful in some specific scenarios but are generally less favored today.</p>

  <summary><strong>14. What migration strategies from JavaScript to TypeScript do you know?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript improves code quality, adds static typing, and eases maintenance. Here are common migration strategies:
  </p>
  <h4>1. Incremental Migration</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Add TypeScript to the existing project by installing it and creating a <code>tsconfig.json</code>.</li>
    <li>Rename some <code>.js</code> files to <code>.ts</code> or <code>.tsx</code> gradually.</li>
    <li>Add type annotations progressively, starting with new or critical code.</li>
    <li>Use <code>// @ts-check</code> comments in JavaScript files for basic type checking.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pros:</b> No need to rewrite everything at once. Can focus on important parts first.</p>
  <p><b>Cons:</b> Mixed codebase can be harder to maintain. Migration can take a long time.</p>

  <h4>2. Strict Mode with Lax Settings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable <code>"strict": true</code> in <code>tsconfig.json</code>.</li>
    <li>Initially disable some strict rules like <code>noImplicitAny</code> or <code>strictNullChecks</code> for easier migration.</li>
    <li>Gradually tighten rules over time as more code is converted.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pros:</b> Flexible control over strictness. Gradual improvement of type safety.</p>
  <p><b>Cons:</b> Requires careful config tuning and time.</p>

  <h4>3. Refactor with New Files</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Write all new features exclusively in TypeScript.</li>
    <li>Rewrite old code files in TypeScript only when necessary or during refactoring.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pros:</b> Keeps new development moving fast without immediate rewrites.</p>
  <p><b>Cons:</b> Codebase remains mixed for longer, consistency may suffer.</p>

  <h4>4. Full Migration</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Rename all <code>.js</code> files to <code>.ts</code>.</li>
    <li>Rewrite entire project adding proper typings.</li>
    <li>Use automated migration tools if available.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Pros:</b> Complete and consistent TypeScript adoption with full type safety.</p>
  <p><b>Cons:</b> Time-consuming, risky for large projects, requires significant effort.</p>

  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <p>
    The choice depends on project size, resources, and deadlines. Incremental migration is the most popular for existing projects, while full migration suits new or small projects. Using strict mode with gradual tightening ensures better code quality over time.
